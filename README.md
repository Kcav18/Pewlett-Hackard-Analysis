# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis for Pewlett Hackard was to determine the number of retiring employees per title and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This will help management prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.


## Results

- There are 300,024 employees in the Pewlett-Hackard Employee Database.
- There are currently 72,548 positions that will soon be eligible for retirement!
- The majority of the positions that will be vacant after the employees retire are senior level posiions. This includes Senior Engineers, Senior Staff, and Engineer roles. See the table below that outlines the positioins that will need to eventually be filled.
- Only 1,549 current employees will qualify for the mentorship program.

## Summary

1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? There will be a total of 72,548 positions that need to be filled as this tsunami takes place.

2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? Yes. From the data, it appears that there are many senior level soon to be retirees that will be able to mentor the next generation of senior level employees. And then those employees can mentor the other staff and new staff who take over their positions. The mentorship eligibility paramaters may need to be expanded though because based on the current standard, there will only be 1,549 employees who qualify for the mentorship program. Lots of retirees and very few employees to be mentored.
